    He is mostly known for his signature high-energy anthemic trap sound, but has also delved into other music genres,
    like dubstep, as heard in his song "Mechanical Mayhem", along with electro music and house music. His innovative sound design is coupled by aggressive, dance-ready arrangements.

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Aero Chord began in 2013. In an interview with Your EDM, Vlastaras spoke on the origins of the name Aero Chord,
            stating "Well, my name wasn't something easy to decide on. It took me at least 2 months of looking through name generators
            and combining their outputs endlessly until something good and meaningful and unique came up. When I saw Aero Chord it just clicked I guess.
            I started producing at the age of 14 I think, inspired by a cousin of mine who was making Goa and psy-trance back then and who helped me through my first steps with Reason.
            I've never DJ'ed much in my life before Aero Chord, I just knew I have to go through productions first to gain some recognition so I saw no point in it."
            Since he began, Vlastaras has signed with Monstercat and has released numerous songs under the label, most recently "4U".
